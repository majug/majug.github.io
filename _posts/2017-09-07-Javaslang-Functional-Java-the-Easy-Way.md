### Abstract

This talk will introduce you to Javaslang, a library that borrows heavily from Scala and applies Scala's ideas to plain old Java. We will cover some of the productivity enhancements and syntactic sugar that Javaslang offers, such as pattern matching aka. structural composition, value types and functional data types.

Javaslang can be a building block for functional business code, that is easy to maintain and understand. It consists of a broad set of ideas and enhancements to Java and makes developing in a more-or-less functional style so much easier. Developers that have tried Scala but have to develop business assets using Java do not have to despair anymore.

This quick overview shows how to improve business code using Javaslang using actual code from our projects (although anonymized for obvious reasons) and give a taste of the features and benefits a small library like Javaslang offers.
