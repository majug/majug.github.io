### Abstract
Quarkus was released on March 2019 in a galaxy not too far away (actually Neuch창tel, Switzerland) by a team of engineers that dreamed of supercharging Java for Cloud/Kubernetes native deployments, while bringing Joy back to Developers. Come to this talk to find out how Quarkus embraces the AI/LLM universe by integrating with the popular langchain4j library, and get ideas for crafting your own intelligent applications!
