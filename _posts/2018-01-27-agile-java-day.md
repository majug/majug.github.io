### Abstract

Venkat Subramaniam is a widely known author and speaker at many international conferences. As part of his world-wide [50 JUG tour](http://blog.agiledeveloper.com/2017/06/a-small-man-with-big-aspiration-tour.html) he will come to Mannheim (the only stop in Germany!) for a day of teaching on Java topics. 
We are looking forward to have him presenting the following topics:

#### Exploring Java 9

If Java 8 was all about how we code, Java 9 is all about how we will build. Modularization will have the biggest impact of any change that happened in Java since its inception. In this presentation we will learn about the need for modularization, how it impacts development, the rules to follow when creating modules, and the effect it has on legacy code. We will explore creating module, using modules, readability, exports, automatic modules, and unnamed modules.

#### From Functional to Reactive Programming:

We're in the midst of renewed interest in functional programming. At the same time we see quite a bit of excitement around reactive programming. Where did reactive programming come from? How is it related to functional programming, if at all? In this presentation we will discuss the merits of reactive programming and how functional programming concepts seamlessly transition into the programming model espoused by reactive programming.


#### The Power and Perils of Parallel Streams

"If streams can be parallel, why not make them parallel all the time?" is a common question from developers getting introduced to Java 8 streams. In this talk we'll take on three separate topics. 1. When to consider parallelization and when not to. 2. How to parallelize, how to decide on number of threads, and how to control the threads pool. 3. Learn about some common mistakes people make when using parallel streams. The goal of this talk is for us to learn when and how to make good use of parallel streams.

#### Twelve Ways to Make Code Suck Less 

We all have seen our share of bad code and some really good code as well. What are some of the common anti patterns that seem to be recurring over and over in code that sucks? By learning about these code smells and avoiding them, we can greatly help make our code better. Come to this talk to learn about some common code smell and how to improve the quality of code.
