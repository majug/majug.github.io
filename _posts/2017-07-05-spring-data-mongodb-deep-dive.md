### Abstract

Spring Data is a high-level project in the Spring project portfolio for relational and NoSQL data stores. Spring Data MongoDB provides Document-to-Object mapping, an abstraction to work with MongoDB data and means to use MongoDB features efficiently. I'll walk you in the More-Code-Than-Slides session through Spring Data basics, we'll have a detailed look on the MongoDB Aggregation framework and you'll learn which Mongo 3.4 features you can use already today with Spring Data MongoDB.
